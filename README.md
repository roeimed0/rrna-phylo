# rRNA-Phylo

Attempt at rRNA prediction and a whole encompassing phylogenetic tree simulator that combines many methods and shows possible interpretations.

## Features

### rRNA Prediction
- Prokaryotic rRNA detection (16S, 23S, 5S)
- Eukaryotic rRNA detection (18S, 28S, 5.8S, 5S)
- Support for both trained models and traditional methods

### Phylogenetic Analysis
- Multiple tree building methods (Distance, ML, Bayesian)
- Interactive tree visualization
- Method comparison and interpretation tools
- Bootstrap and support value analysis
